## Morning Clarity Review

1. Set the space: No phone. Just coffee, journal, and silence.

"2. Prompt: What is the most important work I'm here to do over the next few years?"

… Trying to be my best version of myself, moment to moment.

3. Prompt: Where can I invest my time and energy today for the highest long-term return?

… Reflecting again and visualizing my best self.
… Cleaning my apartment.
… Calming my mind.
… Thinking about how things will go great if I just do the work.

4. Prompt: What must I stop doing to protect this mission?

… Jumping into work reactively without planning.
    
5. Choose one clear action for today that aligns with your heroic path.

… Practice pausing and choosing your response from that stimulus to reaction space.
