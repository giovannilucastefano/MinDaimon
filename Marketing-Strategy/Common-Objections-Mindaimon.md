\n💘 Top 10 Common Objections (Mindaimon Framework)

Field feedback for possible objections when introducing the Mindaimon framework, especially during events or in early onboarding:

1. ✨"“I don’t have time to add another tool/system."’
… Time is already tight, and adding something new feels overwhelming.

 2. “I'‚m not tech-savvy / AI is too complicated for me."’
… Fear of a learning curve or confusion around using AI tools.

 3. “Ive tried productivity tools before and they didn’t work.”
(�� Skepticism from past disappointments or tool fatigue.

 4. “I&not even clear on my goals yet, so this won’t help..”
… Lack of clarity can make people feel unready for structured tools.

 5. “I work better alone-’t i don’t want to rely on a community..”
… Some people may not value group reflection or feel it’s distracting.

-
6. “This sounds too good to be true.”
… Doubts about whether AI or frameworks can really deliver results.

 7. “I prefer physical journaling / notebooks.”
… Resistance to digital tools due to habit or emotional attachment.

 8. “I need personal time when much of this would be online..”
… Privacy concerns, especially around community or cloud-based tools.

-
9. “It feels too abstract or conceptual...”
… Some might struggle to see the concrete, immediate benefit.

 10. “It’s not for my stage‘this feels too early/advanced for me..”
… They feel either behind (e.g. “I need basics first”) or that the tool is for a more experienced user.
