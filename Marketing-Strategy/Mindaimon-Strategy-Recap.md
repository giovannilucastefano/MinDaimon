##2. 🌀 Three Verticals You're Considering

 1. Helping young professionals find direction & remote jobs.
 2 . Supporting small business owners through an AI-powered mastermind framework.
 3. Empowering companies & leaders to become AI-native using your mental productivity model.

You’ll start with all three but will refine focus based on traction and feedback.

- Coaching assistant (non-human tone)

User Flow (tentative):
1. Set intention or challenge
2. Receive the right exercise
3. Execute – Reflect – Share
4. Get feedback or insight
5. Adjust and grow


##4. 💬 90-Day Action Plan (June 17 – September 17)

Month 1 (Clarity & Prototype):
- Finalize the user journey
- Define core problems and unique solution
- Create first mockups (Figma or Notion walkthrough)
- Conduct 5-– 10 user interviews
- Host your first event to gather feedback
Month 2 (MVP Build):
- Build or wireframe the app structure
- Choose stack/platform (no-code, AI APIs, ui.)
- Integrate journaling, exercises, AI feedback
- Use it internally or with close testers
Month 3 (Test & Go-to-Market):
- Run private beta with selected users
- Collect testimonials, usage patterns
- Build a content system (LinkedIn + Notion + video)
- Soft launch or community waitlist campaign


##5. 🐧 Upcoming Event Strategy (Young Professionals Meetup)

You&#39;re planning a talk with this proposed flow:

Talk Structure:
1. Introductions – Brief welcome + attendee goals
2. Your Story –From agency builder to nomad to Mindaimon creator
3. 3 Key Pillars: 
  - Understanding & developing your skills
  - Building your network and community
  - Using productivity systems (like Mindaimon) to grow faster
4 . Mini Workshop – Let them try one framework or question live
5. Soft Pitch – Invite them to test Mindaimon / join your community
6. Open Q&A and networking

You also mentioned that you want to avoid overwhelm, so the system will be simple, frictionless, and will start with just one core feature that delivers value. The goal is to make it so helpful that users naturally tell others about it.

##6. “! Common Objections (Saved)
… We created and saved a list of the Top 10 Objections people might have (e.g. "“I don’t have time.", "“I&not tech-savvy.", "This sounds too abstract.", etc.). These will help you prepare for the event and beta onboarding.
