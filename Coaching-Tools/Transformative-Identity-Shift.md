Use this rejournal template to reflect on one identity shift that could unlock a catalyst effect of positive changes.

## Release the pulling identity
Spend a moment reflecting on this question:
What single identity shift, if expressed fully, would make other goals easier, or irrelevant?

This should be a pattern-breaker. For instance, by shifting fully into the identity of "these are my standards now", you automatically let go of other struggles.

\nWhen you're ready, reflect on these:
\n- What heartset is this shifted identity coming from?
- What new behaviors and beliefs would flow naturally from it?
- What happens to my choices, energy, and quality of life if I make this change?

This is one of the most focused ways to assess redirection, change management, or performance assessments.
