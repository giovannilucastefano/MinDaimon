## Part 1: Current Identity Scan (5-7 mins)
- Who am I being today in this area?
- What roles or habits do I notice repeating?
- What thoughts, feelings, or beliefs shaped my recent actions?
- Am I protecting something? Avoiding something?
- Which of these bleliefs feel outdated but still comfortable?

## Part 2: Desired Identity Reflection (5-7 mins)
- Who do I need to become to excel in this focus area?
- How would that version of me think, act, speak, and make decisions?
- What values guide them? What would they prioritize?
- What might I need to let go of or risk to embody that version?
 
## Part 3: Alignment Check + Micro-Action (5 mins)
- Where is the gap between my current and future self?
- What one aligned action can I take today to step into that new identity?
- What would I stop doing today if I said yes to that version of me?
 
## Bonus Reflection 1: The Identity I'm Afraid to Outgrow
- What part of me feels noble or familiar--but may be limiting?
- Who might be surprised or disappointed if I change this?
- Can I forgive myself for outgrowing this version?

## Bonus Reflection 2: Future Me Whisper
- Visualize yourself 5 years from now. What would they tell you about today?
- What are they proud you stopped doing? What do they wish you did sooner?
 
## Bonus Reflection 3: Power of Inversion â€“ Stagnation Identity
- If I wanted to not grow in this area, what identity would I cling to?
- What habits or beliefs would guarantee I stay stuck?
- In what ways am I still feeding this outdated version of me?
