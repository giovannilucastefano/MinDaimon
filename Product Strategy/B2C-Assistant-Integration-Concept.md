## Proposal

Reflective coach mode for B-UC platform.

Bring the micro-reflection daily prompt, checkin back on your dream project, and terception, this same button can be used in a wider B2C app to increase engagement.

The agent can start with: *"What's on your mind today?"
- Light prompts
- Logs to Obsidian vault
Luck screen widget option to view streak, reflection highlights, or based checkins.

Value is not full only in the content of the agent, but in the symbolic trigger to reflect and show up.
