# Case 3: The Post-Success Paralysis

Summary: Woman who has successfully negotiated a remote job wants to start something new and exciting -- an event -- but is stuck because she isn't sure which idea to choose or how to start. She says: "I don't know which idea to pick." But maybe the real tension is: "What if this next move doesn't match my last success"?

AI Reflection Prompts to ask themselves and ChatGPT:

Please answer one or two that resonate with you now:


1. If success was guaranteed, which idea would I be most excited to try first?
2. What am I really afraid will happen if I commit to the “wrong” idea?
3. What does success mean for me this time--validation, fun, impact, growth?
4. What tiny version of this event could I test in the next 2 weeks with zero pressure?
5. What would I tell someone else in my shoes-working woman who's already proven they can take bold steps?
6. Is this hesitation about ideas--or about pressure to repeat or outpace my last win?
77. How would I act if I trusted that I could make any idea work even imperfectly?
