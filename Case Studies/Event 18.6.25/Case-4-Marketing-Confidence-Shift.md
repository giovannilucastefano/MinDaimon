## ‚ÄòCoaching Frame for AI Self-Discovery ‚Äô(LuisEdition)

Set up prompt to paste into ChatGPT: 

Hi, I want to reflect and gain clarity about my next career steps, especially around marketing and freelancing. Please act as a mix of a mindset coach, a productivity strategist, and a business mentor. Your tone should be warm, empowering, and practical‚Äîdon't just give me solutions; 
My situation: I'm exploring web development (mainly WordPress) and online marketing. I‚Äôm still studying, but I ‚Äôd like to start taking on small clients. I feel hesitant and unsure if I‚Äôm ‚Äôgood enough‚Äù to start. I need help understanding what‚Äôs really holding me back and how to start acting with more confidence and clarity.

I'll send you 10 reflection prompts I want to explore. Help me unpack each one so I can take real steps forward.

## Reflection Questions:

If I fully trusted I was ready to start, what‚Äôs one thing I would do this week?

2. What do I fear will happen if I put myself out there and fail publicly?

3. What inner rule or hidden commitment might be holding me...

4. How can I reframe this from a test of worth into a learning journey?
5. What emotion do I avoid by not offering my skills to real people yet?

V 6. What kind of project would feel meaningful enough that‚Äîeven if I failed‚Äî Id have been proud that I tried?

7. How can I use AI to help me structure, practice, or gain confidence?

V 8. What would I tell someone else in my exact situation right now?

9. What‚Äôs one low-stakes offer I could make to help someone this week--no pressure, just service?

V 10. Am I waiting to feel ‚Äúready‚Äù‚Äîor could action itself make me feel more ready?
