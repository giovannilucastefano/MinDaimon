#*AI Reflection Prompts for Self-Discovery**

Please write the following reflective questions to explore your thoughts or use an Iai-assisted tool like ChatGPT: 


1. If everything *did* work out—no limitations—what would my best-case scenario look like one year from now?
2. What part of my identity am I astraid to let go of--and what part of me is ready for something new.
3. What small experiment could I run that honors my past (nursing) while exploring my future (remote lifestyle)?
2.4 What am I afraid I’ll lose by choosing the "wrong" next step —and how real is that risk?
5. How could I design a bridge between two paths instead of choosing one over the other?
6. Is it possible I already know what I want—but I'm hesitating because it feels too bold or unsure yet?
77. What would I tell someone else in my exact situation right now?
8  . If I had 10% more belief in myself, what would I try this month?
