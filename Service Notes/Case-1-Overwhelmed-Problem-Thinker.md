Scenario:

\nWoman reports multiple complex obstacles like taxes, remote work issues, and clients. Externally, these seem to block her progress, without clear forward motion.

\nMyth als she sees it: "There are too many external issues."

\nClarity Prompts: \n\n1. What part of this situation is actually under your right today?\n2. Are you spending more energy highlighting the problem or experimenting solutions? \n3. If you had to act like the solution was possible, what would you try first? \n4. What’s one emotionally uncomfortable move that would likely create the most momentum? \n5. What are you afraid might happen if you tried and it didn't work? Is that fear real or an assumption?\n\nRemember, often the most effective solution is the one that feels the hardest emotionally \u0023 that’s where the shift begins.\n\nSuggested Micro-Action: \nList three possible next moves. Star the one that makes you nervous. That’s probably the one that matters. Try it in the next two days, even imperfectly.
