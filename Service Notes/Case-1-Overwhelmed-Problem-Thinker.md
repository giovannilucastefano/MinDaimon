# Case 1: The Overwhelmed Problem Thinker

 Summary: Woman feels stuck in problem-thinking loops. She lists external obstacles like german taxes, remote work laws, and finding clients, but can't see her way through it.
 
 Mislabeled Problem: "There are too many external issues."
 Real issue: Problem-thinking without commitment to solution-testing.
 
#*AI Reflection Prompts for Self-Discovery**

Please write down a thought or situation that feels stuck. Then answer the following reflective questions:

 1. What part of this situation is actually under your control today?
 2. Are you spending more energy explaining the problem or experimenting with solutions?
 3. If you had to act like the solution was possible, what would you try first?
 4. What is one emotionally uncomfortable step that you know could make the most progress?
 5. What are you afraid might happen if you tried and it didn't work? Is that fear real or assumed?

 Remember: often, the most effective solution is the one that feels the hardest emotionally.
