# Case 1: The Overwhelmed Problem Thinker

 Summary: Woman feels stuck in problem-thinking loops. She lists external obstacles like german taxes, remote work laws, and finding clients, but can't see her way through it.
 
 Mislabeled Problem: "There are too many external issues."
 Real issue: Problem-thinking without commitment to solution-testing.
 
#*AI Reflection Prompts for Self-Discovery**

Please write down a thought or situation that feels stuck. Then answer the following reflective questions:

 1. What part of this situation is actually under my control today?
 2. Am I spending more time explaining the problem or testing solutions?
 3. If I had to act like the solution was possible, what would I try first?
4. Which action feels the most emotionally uncomfortable--but might unlock real progress?
5. What am I afraid might happen if I try and it doesn't work? Is that fear real or untested?
6. How can I rephrase this issue to better see solutions?
 7. Is this about them not giving what I want--or about me not increasing my value so they want to?
8. If I dig deeper, is the core problem technical (e.g., taxes) or emotional (e.g., fear of not being enough)?
9. What is the one thing that, if acchieved, would make everything else easier or unnecessary?
 10. Do I already know the solution---but I'm hesitating because I'm not yet willing to pay the emotional or strategic price?

 **Insight**
 Remember: often, the most effective solution is the one we most resist the most. That's where transformation begins.
