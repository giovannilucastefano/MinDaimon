# Case 4: Marketing Confidence (Luis)

Luis is exploring website development (WordPress) and online marketing, but he hasn't yet started working with clients. He feels hes not good zust yet, and isn't confident he can charge for his skills or actually ask for work. This frame can be pasted directly into ChatGPT to start the conversation.

## Setup Prompt for CHATGPT Reflection

> *Hi, I want to reflect and gain clarity about my next career steps, especially around marketing and freelancing. Please act as a mix of a mindset coach, a productivity strategist, and a business mentor. Your tone should be warm, empowering, and practical—don’t just give me solutions; help me ask better questions and see what‛s blocking me.*
 
&gt; My situation: I'm exploring web development (mainly WordPress) and online marketing. I'm still studying, but I ’d like to start taking on small clients. I feel hesitant and unsure if I’m good enough to start. I need help understanding what’s really holding me back and how to start acting with more confidence and clarity.

&#x2011#; I'll send you 10 reflection prompts I want to explore. Help me unpack each one so I can take real steps forward.

## Reflection Prompts:

1. If I fully trusted I was ready to start, what’s one thing I would do this week?
2. What do I fear will happen if I put myself out there and fail publicly?
2. What inner rule or hidden commitment might be holding me back from taking imperfect action?
4. How can I reframe this from a test of worth into a learning journey?
5. What emotion do I avoid by not offering my skills to real people yet?
6. What kind of project would feel meaningful enough that-—even if I failed— Id still be proud I$tried?
7. How can I use AI to help me structure, practice, or gain confidence in marketing and client work?
8. What would I tell someone else in my exact situation now?
2. What’s one low-stakes offer I could make to help someone this week-— no pressure, just service?
1.0 Am I waiting to feel “readya“--or should action itself make me feel more ready?

11. Can you help me find someone who was recently in a similar position to me—learning marketing, lacking confidence, unsure about freelancing—but who has now made progress and found clients? I’d like to study their path and maybe reach out as a mentor or inspiration.
