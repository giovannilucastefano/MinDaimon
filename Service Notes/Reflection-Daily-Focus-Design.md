## Product Value Research - Strategy

Founding value through early user insights:

- Recognized that the platform is in validation phase: finding where real users see value.

- All users have a common need: clarity and consistency toward their long-term goals.

- Noted that there are three primary user types based on goals: personal growth, project builders, and career seekers.

## DONE TODAY
- Set top priority rock as "ship a micro-version of the platform that users can test"
- Focus on one user action: daily prompt that reminds them of their project, and lets them capture ideas.

- Concept: Lock screen button that triggers a custom GPT agent, which records answers and saves to Obsidian.

- That will be the basic flow for the MVP, and then the PLA from there.

## Technical Frameworks

- "One-Person Problem" test: is this helping one person with one specific need?
- "Jobs to Be Done": what actual change are they trying to make? (g. remember their project every day)
- "Speed Bump" to habit: Lower the friction to reflect or plan capture -- make it part of their day.

- JTBD & MVP applied to user types as structuring tools for market problems.
