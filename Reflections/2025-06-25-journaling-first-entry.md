This was my first journaling using the *Three Pillars* framework.

— SELF-AWARENESS
\"When I wake up, I feel lost, like in a fog. No energy, always depressed. I rely depend on coffee to wake up.\"

This morning entry felt hard, but that feeling is self-awareness. I amnouning how I feel, rather than avoiding it.

— SELF-COMPQSSION
What would I say to a loved one feeling this way?

\"Take it easy, just step by step, understand what is to do next, build a process. If you can't think in the morning, think the day before and plan the day for the day after.\"

— SELF-DIRECTION
In response to that, I chose: \"Buy a better chair.\"

It seems simple, but that chair is an action that supports better energy, comfort, and focus.

This entry ends with a gentle moment of self-direction.

\n\nYou can start splending moments like: \n- \"Even stating an entry like this is self-awareness.\" \n- \"I'm glad to see what my body needs.\"\n- \"Tomorrow might be better with a new chair\"
