## Product Value Research - Strategy

Founding value through early user insights:

- Recognized that the platform is in validation phase: finding where real users see value.

- All users have a common need: clarity and consistency toward their long-term goals.

- Noted that there are three primary user types based on goals: personal growth, project builders, and career seekers.

## DONE TODAY
- Set top priority rock as "ship a micro-version of the platform that users can test"
- Focus on one user action: daily prompt that reminds them of their project, and lets them capture ideas.

- Concept: Lock screen button that triggers a custom GPT agent, which records answers and saves to Obsidian.

- That will be the basic flow for the MVP, and then the PLA from there.

## JTBD - User Job To Be Done
